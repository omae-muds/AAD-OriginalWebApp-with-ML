## This is University Homework

- Creating a WebApp with Machine Learning
  - Pytho CGI is used in the course material.
  - We can use any framework.

We were allowed to create most of them freely, **but it meant very hard work.**

## My Challenge, Growth

- I used the tools Black, PyFlake and MyPy for the first time.
- It's not my first time creating a WebApp, but it's close.

- I used FastAPI for the first time.
- I wrote TypeHint for the first time.
- First time asynchronous programming.
- To reduce the load of front-end development, I chose Bulma as a CSS framework.

- Deployed a Python program to Heroku for the first time.
- First time to use Reddis.
- Using Deta Base, which is similar to Key-Value Store.
- Using Deta Drive for storage.
